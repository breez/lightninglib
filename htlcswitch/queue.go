// current commitment transaction. An HTLC will overflow the current commitment
// transaction if one attempts to add a new HTLC to the state machine which
// already has the max number of pending HTLC's present on the commitment
// transaction.  Packets are removed from the queue by the channelLink itself
// as additional slots become available on the commitment transaction itself.
// In order to synchronize properly we use a semaphore to allow the channelLink
// to signal the number of slots available, and a condition variable to allow
// the packetQueue to know when new items have been added to the queue.
