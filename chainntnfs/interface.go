// implementations such as: btcd's websockets notifications, Bitcoin Core's
// ZeroMQ notifications, various Bitcoin API services, Electrum servers, etc.
//
// Concrete implementations of ChainNotifier should be able to support multiple
// concurrent client requests, as well as multiple concurrent notification events.
// TODO(roasbeef): all events should have a Cancel() method to free up the
// resource
